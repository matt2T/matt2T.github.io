<h2>Pontifications <br><small><i>or Matt's going to rant! Run away.</i></small></h2>

	<p>


I went to Publix today—"where shopping is a pleasure," or so they advertise—only to be met, yet again, by the harsh reality of inflation. A box of Benadryl that used to cost $4 is now nearly $8. My cat's food, which I already thought was pricey at 88 cents per can, has jumped to $1.21. Naturally, the cat refuses to eat anything else but Temptations. By the time I was done, I’d spent over $26 on medicine, cat food, and a bottle of cranberry juice. Needless to say, I wasn’t in the best mood when I got back to the car.</p>

<p>Then, to top it off, I turned on the radio, only to be assaulted again—this time by yet another commercial from a children’s charity, trying to guilt listeners into donating because some stranger’s child has a birth defect or developmental issue. Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for charity, but these ads push it too far, making it seem like the fate of these kids is on our shoulders. The marketing teams probably think they’re being noble, but it feels exploitative—just another way to wring more money out of us, with these organizations often tied to the healthcare system itself. I understand everyone needs a job, but it’s depressing that this is where we’ve landed in America.</p>

<p>It’s a shame our tax dollars don’t go toward actually helping the homeless or those with special health needs. I’m not advocating for a fully socialized healthcare system, just for a government that adequately takes care of society's needs—or at least gives people the freedom and resources to take care of themselves. Likewise, maybe religious institutions could humble themselves a bit. Instead of building megachurches that resemble cineplexes, perhaps they could go back to truly caring for their communities.</p>

<p>But I know, it's all just wishful thinking.</p>

<p>Speaking of the government, I heard a report on the radio celebrating that inflation dropped by 2%. What they didn’t mention is that prices are still rising while wages remain stagnant. Good grief.

<h2>Matt's Movie Review</h2>

<h3>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</h3> 
<p>
<i>I saw this on preview night, Wednesday before opeining, and posted a short blurb on my Twitter account already.  Here is a litte more detail.</i><br><br> I enjoyed it, but despite my low expectations, I was hoping for a bit more. It’s definitely original, if somewhat messy—though that’s often the case with Burton’s films. It's more visually driven and character-based than narrative-focused. The characters are entertaining but feel somewhat extraneous, which detracts from what could have been a stronger payoff with Keaton, Ryder, Ortega, and O'Hara. The ending left me a bit puzzled, but once the final twist hit, I appreciated the nod to Burton’s signature style, reminiscent of Mars Attacks! and Dark Shadows. Burton is fully committed to his unique vision (partially inspired by Ed Wood), so it's either something you embrace or not. Compared to the original, it’s a decent sequel and I found myself invested in the Deetz family's troubles. However, Burton’s handling of the Maitlands' storyline, with its “loophole,” felt like a lazy writing choice. Overall, this sequel is likely best suited for long-time Burton fans with tempered expectations, or anyone in the mood for a quirky, zany Halloween popcorn flick.</p>

<p>Yes, as a Burton fan, <em>I will be adding Beetlejuice Beetlejuice to my collection</em>." If you enjoyed Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice you might enjoy "Wednesday" on Netflix but I advise skipping Burton's previous film for Disney...ugggh..."Dumbo"</p>

I, an old school, Tim Burton fan enjoyed it. Not the classic that Beetlejuice was but as far as sequels goes its entertaining. More cartoonish and less charming but it has its moments and a twist on those happy girlie, sappy, Disney endings.</p>&mdash; Mattrocious (@Matthew27539581) <a href="https://twitter.com/Matthew27539581/status/1831510413164286256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
